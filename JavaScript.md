## How JavaScript Works & Execution Context:
[Namaste JavaScript Ep.1](https://youtu.be/ZvbzSrg0afE) <br />
Everything in javascript happens inside a **Execution Context**: <br />
we can assume the 'Execution Context' as a big box or container in which whole JS code is executed. <br/>
'Execution Context' has two component, first one is ***memory component*** also known as **Variable Environment** <br />
and the second component is ***code component*** also called as **Thread of Execution**. <br /><br/>
**Variable Environment(memory component):-** this is the place in which all the variables and functions are stored in **key:value** pairs <br/>
**Thread of Excetion(code component):-** this is the place where code is executed one line at a time, thats where the words comes in > ***JavaScript is a Syncronous Single-Threaded Language***. <br/>
single threaded means it only executes one line at a time, syncronous single threaded means JS can only executes one line at a time in a specific order, it will only move to the next line only if the current line execution is finished.
